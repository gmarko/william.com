	<p class="tutorial-paragraph tutorial-intro">
		ngrx/store is a state management tool for Angular applications powered by rxjs. It allows for easy management
		of your application's state data and is very useful for when you have an application that needs to display the same data
		in multiple places on the same view.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The idea behind the store architecture is that you can update state variables anywhere,
		and have that reflected in multiple places in your application. This is achieved by using
		reactive models that listen to state observables. To see the official documentation on ngrx/store, visit
		the github page <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ngrx/store">here</a>.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Before we begin, you will need to install the appropriate dependencies.
	</p>

	<pre class="terminal-command">
npm install @ngrx/core @ngrx/store @ngrx/effects @ngrx/router-store --save
npm install @ngrx/devtools --save-dev
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-note">Note: All of our store related files will all be kept under src/app/store</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		This store architecture is achieved by using four main tools: Actions, Effects, Reducers, and Selectors. We will
		visit each of these in turn, to see how they allow us to interact with the store. Let's begin with the application state
		itself.
	</p>

	<h4 class="tutorial-header">The Application State</h4>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The application state is how you declare to the store what variables you want to keep in the store. This will include any data
		that is important to your application. For example, if we are building an application that needs to keep track of user's hobbies and
		sports, we would need to declare to the store that we want to store those two datasets. We do that in a application-state.ts file
		as seen below.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import &#123;RouterState&#125; from "@ngrx/router-store";
import &#123;INITIAL_HOBBY_DATA, hobbyData&#125; from "./hobby-data";
import &#123;INITIAL_SPORT_DATA, sportData&#125; from "./sport-data";

export interface ApplicationState &#123;

	router: RouterState;
	hobbyData: HobbyData;
	sportData: SportData;

&#125;

export const INITIAL_APPLICATION_STATE: ApplicationState = &#123;

	hobbyData: INITIAL_HOBBY_DATA,
	sportData: INITIAL_SPORT_DATA,
	router: &#123;
		path: ''
	&#125;

&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The initial application state is just to tell the store what to initialize all the store data to. You will need to set initial values
		for all your state members. You will notice that we are importing application state components from other files. This is to modularize our code, and make
		it easier to read and understand. The router definition in the ApplicationState is something handled entirely by ngrx/store and it
		basically allows the store to keep track of routing changes within the application. This is totally optional. The hobby-data.ts file
		located next to application-state.ts would look like this:
	</p>


	<pre class="normal-code">
export interface HobbyData &#123;
	hobbies: Hobby[];
&#125;

export const INITIAL_HOBBY_DATA: HobbyData = &#123;
	hobbies: []
&#125;
</pre>
	<p class="caption">/store/hobby-data.ts</p>

	<p class="caption">Note that the Hobby class would be defined as a model elsewhere in your project directory.</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		You can have as many separate data modules as you need, just remember to include them in the main ApplicationState above.
		Now that you have your application state defined, we need to initialize the application state and store in your app module.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import &#123;RouterModule&#125; from "@angular/router";
import &#123;StoreDevtoolsModule&#125; from "@ngrx/store-devtools";
import &#123;Action, StoreModule&#125; from "@ngrx/store";
import &#123;EffectsModule&#125; from "@ngrx/effects";
import &#123;routerReducer, RouterStoreModule&#125; from '@ngrx/router-store';

import &#123;SportEffectService&#125; from "./store/effects/sport-effect.service";


export function storeReducer(state: ApplicationState, action: Action): ApplicationState &#123;
	return &#123;
		hobbyData: hobbyData(state.hobbyData, action),
		sportData: sportData(state.sportData, action),
		router: routerReducer(state.router, action)

		EffectsModule.run(HobbyEffectService),
		EffectsModule.run(SportEffectService)
	],
	...
&#125;)
export class AppModule &#123; &#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		So we just saw a lot of stuff that probably doesn't make any sense. So let's try to figure this out top-to-bottom.
		First we defined something called a storeReducer, this basically handles changes in the application state, and will be
		triggered whenever the store hears an action. That probably doesn't make much sense now but don't worry we will discuss actions and reducers
		in the next section. In our imports we see that we actually initiate the ngrx/store by
		using StoreModule.provideStore(...), and here we pass the main application reducer and the initial state of our application that
		we defined above. Below that we connect our router and set up the debugging tool for ngrx store applications. This connects to
		a chrome extension you can find <a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en">here</a>.
		Below that we are activating our effect services which you don't have to worry about for now.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-header">Actions and Reducers</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Actions are what get called when you want to update your application state in some way. Perhaps you want to add some new data
		into the store, for example. Reducers are what answer those actions, and update the state accordingly. So let's take a look at an
		example action first.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import &#123;Action&#125; from "@ngrx/store"

export const HOBBIES_LOADED_ACTION = 'HOBBIES_LOADED_ACTION'

export class HobbiesLoadedAction implements Action &#123;
	type = HOBBIES_LOADED_ACTION;
	constructor(public payload?: Hobbies[]) &#123; &#125;
&#125;
</pre>
	<p class="caption">/store/actions/hobbyActions.ts</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		This is what an action looks like. Every action will have a type, which is how reducers tell which actions they want to listen to,
		and an optional constructor, which would carry the data associated with the action. You would call this action anywhere in your application,
		for example if you wanted to do so in a controller, you would use the store's dispatch method which basically just executes an action.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import &#123;Store&#125; from "@ngrx/store"
constructor(private store: Store&lt;ApplicationState&gt;) &#123; &#125;
housesLoaded() &#123;
	...
	this.store.dispatch(new HobbiesLoadedAction(houses));
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Once the action is executed, the store will find the root storeReducer, (which we defined in app.module above)
		and call it with the application state and the action that was fired. The storeReducer will then call all three sub reducers with their corresponding
		state data and the action. If a reducer is listening to that specific action, it will update it's state. For example, the hobbyData reducer
		will be listening to the HobbiesLoadedAction and it will look like:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
export function hobbyData(state: HobbyData, action: Action): HobbyData &#123;

	switch (action.type) &#123;
		case HOBBIES_LOADED_ACTION:
			return handleHobbiesLoadedAction(state, action);
		default:
			return state;
	&#125;

&#125;

function handleHobbiesLoadedAction(state: HobbyData, action: HobbiesLoadedAction): HobbyData &#123;
	const newHobbyData = _.cloneDeep(state);
	newHobbyData.hobbies = _.cloneDeep(action.payload);
	return newHobbyData;
&#125;
</pre>
	<p class="caption">/store/reducers/hobbyDataReducer.ts</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Ok let's take a look at what we're doing. The hobbyData() function will be called by the main stateReducer
		defined in app.module with the HobbyData state and the action that was just executed. The hobbyData
		will check if it needs to respond to that action type by using a switch statement. If there is a match (which there is)
		it will return it's handleHobbiesLoadedAction(). If not, like the other two reducers that were just called by stateReducer,
		it will just return the original state it was provided, and not modify the state in any way.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The handleHobbiesLoadedAction will take the state and action, and it will also return a new hobbyData state as well.
		we are setting the HobbyData.hobbies state variable to the action payload that we just received. (Remember when we called the action
		with a parameter hobbies? That parameter is the payload we're seeing here.) We are creating copies of both objects using
		lodash's cloneDeep command to make sure we don't edit the original objects. Then we just return our new
		hobby data state, which will get passed up the line and eventually get set as the new hobby state by the ngrx store.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-header">Selectors</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Great, so we just learned how to update our state with new data, but how can we get our store data and display it on our view? After all,
		that's why we're doing all this! Well, ngrx store provides us with Selectors, which is a way to "select" what data we want to get, and be
		able to subscribe to that data too so we always get the most up-to-date data. Here's an example of a selector that gets us our hobbies array.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import &#123;ApplicationState&#125; from "../application-state";
export function hobbiesSelector(state: ApplicationState): Hobby[] &#123;
	return state.hobbyData.hobbies;
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="caption">/store/selectors/hobbies-selector.ts</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		So we can see that selectors are just really simple functions that take the application state as a parameter,
		and return some value nested inside our application state. These selectors will need to be subscribed to inside your
		component, or wherever you want to access the data. Here is an example of getting the hobbies in the initializer of a component.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">

import &#123;hobbiesSelector&#125; from "/store/selectors/hobbies-selector";

...

hobbies: Hobby[];
hobbies$: Observable&lt;Hobby[]&gt;;
hobbiesSubscription: Subscription;

constructor(private store: Store&lt;ApplicationState&gt;

ngOnInit() &#123;
	this.hobbies$ = this.store.select(hobbiesSelector);
	this.hobbiesSubscription$ = this.hobbies$.subscribe(hobbies => &#123;
		if (hobbies) &#123;
			this.hobbies = _.cloneDeep(hobbies);
		&#125;
	&#125;
&#125;
ngOnDestroy() &#123;
	this.hobbiesSubscription$.unsubscribe();
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		So we have three component variables that manage our hobbies, one to store the state data,
		one to subscribe to and one to store the subscription, so that we can unsubscribe
		when we leave the component. When we subscribe to hobbies$, we will get an array of hobbies as
		a parameter whenever the store updates the hobbyData.hobbies array. We then copy these hobbies into a
		state variable so we can use it in our view, but this is kind of messy so we can actually use an async pipe
		in our view instead!
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
# Change the component to just this one line
ngOnInit() &#123;
	this.hobbies$ = this.store.select(hobbiesSelector);
&#125;

# And in the view we can use hobbies$ directly.
&lt;hobbies-list [hobbies]="hobbies$ | async"&gt;&lt;/hobbies-list&gt;

# The hobbies-list component will just have an input for hobbies
export class HobbiesListComponent &#123;
	@Input() hobbies;
	...
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		And we just let the hobbies-list component display the hobbies that it gets from it's input. So
		using Actions, Reducers, and Selectors, we can effectively update and retrieve state data from our store.
		Super simple right? Well there's just one more part of the entire store architecture, and that's effects.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-header">Effects</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Effects are basically side-effects that trigger when certain actions are fired. They listen to actions just like
		reducers but they have the ability to make service calls when events are fired. So they can be used to respond to
		a LoadHobbiesAction and call a hobbyService to fetch the data. They can also fire an event after they execute
		a service call, so they can call HobbiesLoadedAction after the hobbies have been fetched. You can define an effect like so:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import ...

@Injectable()
export class HobbyEffectService &#123;

	constructor (
		private actions$: Actions,
		private hobbyService: HobbyService,
		private store: Store&lt;ApplicationState&gt;
	) &#123; &#125;

	@Effect() loadHobbies$ = this.actions$
		.ofType(LOAD_HOBBIES_ACTION)
		.switchMap(action => Observable
			.from(
				// Payload is user uid
				this.hobbyService.getHobbiesFromServer()
			).catch(
				(err) => &#123;
					console.error(err);
					return Observable.empty();
				&#125;
			)
		)
		.map(hobbies => new HobbiesLoadedAction(hobbies));
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		This effect once initiated in the app module, will listen for actions of type LOAD_HOBBIES_ACTION, and when
		it gets called, it will switchmap the action observable into a service call, which is assumed to be an observable
		as well. Once the data is retrieved, it is mapped to an action call which will add the data in the hobby reducer.
		You initiate this effect in the app module like so:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
@NgModule(&#123;
	declarations: [...],
	imports: [
		...
		EffectsModule.run(HobbyEffectService)
	],
	providers: [
		...
		HobbyEffectService
	],
	bootstrap: [AppComponent]
&#125;)
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Great! Now you know how to make a fully store based application using actions, reducers, effects, and selectors. Just to
		recap: Actions can be fired anywhere with a payload of any type (can be an object or array). Effects and reducers will
		listen to all the actions emitted in your application and will respond to those actions. The difference is that effects can
		call other functions when certain actions are fired but reducers and only modify the state data with the action payload. Selectors
		are for when you want to retrieve data from the store and display it in your application. Remember that selectors need to be
		subscribed to to actually get the data!
	</p>
