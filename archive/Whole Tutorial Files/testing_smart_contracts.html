<div class="tutorial">

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph tutorial-intro">
		There are two ways to test your solidity contracts: using javascript mocha/chai and using another solidity contract. Both
		ways are good but accomplish different goals. You would use a javascript test to test for web3.js interactions with your
		contract, and test it's logistical workings. You would use a solidity test to test contract-to-contract interactions
		to make sure there are no errors. Let's look at javascript tests first.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-header">
		Javascript testing with Mocha and Chai
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Javascript tests are written in this format:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
var MyContract = artifacts.require('./MyContract.sol');

contract('MyContract', function(accounts) &#123;

	var myContractInstance;

	it("should do something", function() &#123;
		return MyContract.deployed().then(function(instance) &#123;
			myContractInstance = instance;
			return chainListInstance.doSomething();
		&#125;).then(function(data) &#123;
			assert.equal(data, value, "value should match data");
		&#125;);
	&#125;);

&#125;)
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-note">
		Note that the artifacts.require do not look for the contract relative to the test file.
		It will compile elsewhere so always just look for your contracts as if they were in the same
		directory
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The contract('myContract'... basically sets up your test environment. Before the
		contract method is called, all of your contracts are deployed to the running ethereum
		client so that you have a clean slate. You can write multiple contract methods in the same
		test if you want to execute multiple tests with a clean environment for each.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The function
		inside the contract method takes a list of accounts from your ethereum client,
		so you can use it anywhere in the test. web3 is also automatically included so you can
		make calls like web3.getBalance(web3.eth.accounts[0]) right in the test. Note that the
		contracts are always deployed from accounts[0] so that will always be the owner of the contract.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		The rest of the test is just standard mocha testing except for where we get our contract
		instance. For that we just use the super simple deployed() method truffle contracts provides us.
		If you need to get more than one contract instance, you can just chain them together like so:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
var MyContract = artifacts.require('./MyContract.sol');
var MySecondContract = artifacts.require('./MySecondContract.sol');

contract('MyContract', function(accounts) &#123;

	var myContractInstance;
	var mySecondContractInstance;

	it("should do something", function() &#123;
		return MyContract.deployed().then(function(instance) &#123;
			myContractInstance = instance;
			return MySecondContract.deployed();
		&#125;).then(function(instance) &#123;
			mySecondContractInstance = instance;
			...
		&#125;);
	&#125;);

&#125;)
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-sub-header">
		Testing for events
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Testing that your contract fires the right events at the right time is also very important.
		Here is an example of an event test:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
it ("should be able to emit events properly", function() &#123;

	return myContractInstance.fireEvent()
		.then(function(txResult) &#123;
			console.log(txResult.logs[0]);
			assert.equal(txResult.logs.length, 1, "There should have been one Log Message emitted.");
			assert.equal(txResult.logs[0].event, "MyContractEvent", "The Log-Event should be MyContractEvent");
		&#125;)

&#125;)
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		This checks that there was one event fired after calling myContractInstance.fireEvent() and that
		the event was called MyContractEvent. You can check for additional data in the event just
		by accessing the logs. You can view the logs by just console.logging them out like above.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		As a general rule of thumb I always like to check balances before and after events
		that modify balances in your contract. (Assuming of course, that your contract has balance mappings)
		You can do so by using a beforeEach method in your test. I also like to get my instances before everything
		so I don't have to do it in every test.
	</p>


	<pre class="normal-code">
var MyContract = artifacts.require('./MyContract.sol');
var MySecondContract = artifacts.require('./MySecondContract.sol');

contract('Change Balance Test', function(accounts) &#123;

	let myContractInstance;
	let mySecondContractInstance;
	let ethAccount0initialBalance;
	let ethAccount1initialBalance;

	before(function() &#123;
		let instanceExchange;
		let instanceToken;
		return MyContract.deployed().then(function (instance) &#123;
			myContractInstance = instance;
			return MySecondContract.deployed();
		&#125;).then(function(instance) &#123;
			mySecondContractInstance = instance;
		&#125;);
	&#125;);

	beforeEach(function() &#123;

		return myContractInstance.getBalance(&#123;from: accounts[0]&#125;);
		&#125;).then(function(balance) &#123;
			ethAccount0initialBalance = balance.toNumber();
			return exchangeInstance.getBalance(&#123;from: accounts[1]&#125;);
		&#125;).then(function(balance) &#123;
			ethAccount1initialBalance = balance.toNumber();
		&#125;)

	&#125;);

&#125;);
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		And then check the balances after the test to make sure that the balances
		add up and differences make sense.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-sub-header">Testing for Exceptions</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Testing for the exceptions in our contract is also very important. It makes sure that our
		contract throws under the right conditions, and the exceptions are given when we want them to.
		Having exceptions that we want to fire not fire can be just as bad as getting exceptions when we don't
		want them. Here's how you can test for an exception in your contract:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
it("should throw an exception", function() &#123;

	return MyContract.deployed().then(function(instance) &#123;
		myContractInstance = instance;
		return myContractInstance.throwException();
	&#125;)
		.then(assert.fail)
		.catch(function(error) &#123;
			assert(error.message.indexOf('invalid opcode') >= 0, "error should be invalid opcode")
		&#125;).then(function() &#123;
			return chainListInstance.getValue();
		&#125;).then(function(data) &#123;
			// Make sure the contract state was not altered
			assert.equal(data.toNumber(), 0, "value must not have changed");
		&#125;);
&#125;);
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		This looks like a normal test except that we are saying that after myContractInstance.throwException()
		is called, we will expect an exception, and we're checking that our exception has the keywords
		'invalid opcode', since that is what all solidity exceptions will look like. After that, we just want to
		run through our data and check that none of it has altered since the exception.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		And that's it! The most difficult of writing solidity tests is to logically think about all the things
		you want to test for and what could go wrong. But sometimes we will need to write solidity tests to test for
		contract-to-contract interactions, so let's take a look at that now.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-header">Testing with Solidity</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Solidity tests are written in this format:
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import "truffle/Assert.sol";
import "truffle/DeployedAddresses.sol";
import "../contracts/MyContract.sol";

contract TestMyContract &#123;
  function testInitialNameWithDeployedMyContract() &#123;
    MyContract myContract = MyContract(DeployedAddresses.MyContract());

    uint expected = "myName";

    Assert.equal(myContract.getName(), expected, "Name should be myName");
  &#125;

  function testInitialNameWithNewMyContract() &#123;
    MyContract myContract = new MyContract();

    uint expected = "myName";

    Assert.equal(myContract.getName(), expected, "Name should be myName");
  &#125;
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Some things to note:
	</p>

	<ul class="tutorial-list">
		<li>- All test suites must begin with Test, with a capital T.</li>
		<li>- All tests in that suite must begin with test, with a lowercase t.</li>
		<li>- Each test counts as an individual transaction, so don't make them become too complex.</li>
		<li>
			- Contracts are redeployed for every test suite, so you always get a clean environment.
		</li>
		<li>
			- The addresses of the deployed contracts are retrieved from truffle's deployed addresses file.
			This gets updated every time you migrate your contracts
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		You can also include beforeAll(), beforeEach(), afterAll(), afterEach() functions in your contract.
		These functions also execute as individual functions so if you find one of them becomes too complex for
		a standard transaction (gas too high for example), you can write multiple ones with different suffixes, such as
		beforeEach2(), which would also get called before each test.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-sub-header">Testing for exceptions</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Just like with your javascript tests, you should also test for exceptions with you solidity tests. This
		becomes a little more complicated because if there is a throw exception in a solidity test it will just
		keep throwing up to the caller. This would just break the test! So how can we get around it?
		Simon de la Rouviere writes a pretty good article on it <a target="_blank" href="http://truffleframework.com/tutorials/testing-for-throws-in-solidity-tests">here</a> but I didn't quite understand
		it the first few times so I thought I would simplify it here and explain it a little more.
	</p>

	<pre class="normal-code">
import "truffle/Assert.sol";

// Proxy contract for testing throws
contract ThrowProxy &#123;
	address public target;
	bytes data;
	// Constructor method to set the address of the contract we want to exception test.
	function ThrowProxy(address _target) &#123;
		target = _target;
	&#125;
	// This gets called whenever you call an unknown method on ThrowProxy
	function() &#123;
		data = msg.data;
	&#125;
	// Actually call whatever the target is
	function execute() returns (bool) &#123;
		return target.call(data);
	&#125;
&#125;

// Contract that just throws an exception
contract Thrower &#123;
	function doThrow() &#123;
		throw;
	&#125;
&#125;

// Solidity test contract to test the Thrower contract
contract TestThrower &#123;
	function testThrow() &#123;
		// Initialize our instances
		Thrower thrower = new Thrower();
		ThrowProxy throwProxy = new ThrowProxy(address(thrower));

		// Prime the proxy (discussed below)
		Thrower(address(throwProxy)).doThrow();
		// Call the execute function that will call doThrow() above.
		bool response = throwProxy.execute.gas(200000)();

		Assert.isFalse(response, “Should be false, as it should throw”);
	&#125;
&#125;
</pre>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		So let's see what's happening here. First we have a proxy contract. This is what will
		act as the intermediary between the test and the contract we want to test. This is what allows
		us to make a raw call and not get a throw that will propagate itself to the caller. It
		takes a constructor that will set the target contract's address. (the contract that is to be tested)
		The data state variable is just to carry the calldata when calling the to be tested function (including the
		function identifier stored in the first four bytes of the calldata).
		In this case, it is empty since doThrow() doesn't require any parameters. (since msg.data is just the calldata
		used to call functions)
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Now in the testThrow() test, we are "priming the proxy" which is how we call the fallback function
		in ThrowProxy. It kind of takes the throwProxy address and "casts" it to a Thrower contract so that
		we can call the doThrow() on the proxy. Solidity automatically create the msg.data that we talked about,
		and so our proxy knows which function to execute. Once we call execute on the throwProxy,
		it counts as a raw call instead of a contract call (which won't give us another exception) and we can get
		the response which is a boolean. (true for no exception, false for exception)
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Since throws or asserts will eat up all the gas passed along with the transaction (remember that each
		test counts as a transaction), we wouldn't be able to finish the test if we don't have any gas
		so we have to limit how much gas can actually get thrown out, in this case we give it 200000. If you
		were to be testing against a require() exception, you wouldn't have to specify gas here since it won't
		eat up all your transaction's gas.
	</p>

	<p class="tutorial-header">Conclusion</p>

	<p class="tutorial-paragraph">
		Congratulations! Now you know how to test for every possible situation in solidity. Don't forget that
		the most difficult part of testing is knowing what to test for! The hardest to catch bugs will always
		be the ones that you don't think of, so make sure to test for every possibility. Don't
		forget that you should be spending a great deal more time writing tests than actual code!
